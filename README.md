# About This Project
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

This project is a simple android application which allows the user to: 
1) Take a quiz which consists of 5 MCQs

4) The user gets a countdown of maximum 10 seconds to answer each MCQ.
5) The quiz automatically moves on to next MCQ if the user fails to answer it within 10 seconds
6) After the 5 MCQs are finished, the user lands on the 'ResultScreen' where the app shows how many of the answers were correct.
7) User can press the 'Go to Home' button on the 'ResultScreen' to go back to the 'HomeScreen'.
